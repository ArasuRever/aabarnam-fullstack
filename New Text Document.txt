Based on the backendroutesauth.js file in your repository, there is a temporary auto-create route specifically for your admin account.

The backend admin login credentials are

Email arasu@aabarnam.com

Password SecurePassword123!

Note If you haven't initialized this account in your database yet, you just need to visit httplocalhost5000apiauthcreate-admin in your browser once. This will automatically generate your admin profile, and you can then log in using the credentials above.
